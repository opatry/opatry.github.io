## Debug Ruby code 🔎 💎
<details>
<summary>See details…</summary>

Using Visual Studio Code and `ruby-debug-ide`, initial setup requires to install `binstubs` for few binaries:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle binstubs bundler nanoc ruby-debug-ide
```

Then, debug launch configuration should work out of the box in VS Code (put a breakpoint (in `Rules#preprocess` for example) then press <kbd>F5</kbd>).
