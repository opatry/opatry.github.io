**H₂Go!** is a personal project of a user-friendly Android application designed to help users monitor and improve their daily water consumption. The app's core philosophy is "tech for good," focusing on simplicity, positive reinforcement, and ease of use. The primary interaction—adding a glass of water—should be achievable with a single tap, both from within the app and from a home screen widget.
